**Data Visualizer** is an interactive Python app for exploratory data analysis (EDA) built with Streamlit, Pandas, and Plotly. It allows users to upload CSV files, inspect datasets, and generate dynamic visualizations, helping to quickly understand and explore data.

> Currently a proof-of-concept with plans for integrated data cleaning and enhanced visualizations.

### Main Features
- Upload CSV files for analysis
- Display and inspect datasets
- View general dataset information (shape, column types, basic statistics)
- Generate dynamic visualizations:
  - Histograms
  - Bar charts
  - Scatter plots
  - Correlation heatmaps
- Modular and extensible design to support future features

### Planned Enhancements
- Implement a data cleaning module for missing values, duplicates, and formatting
- Expand the general information section beyond .describe()
- Add more visualization options and interactivity
- Allow selective variable analysis for more precise charts
